# BankSlotsFu

**BankSlotsFu** is a lightweight FuBar addon designed exclusively for **World of Warcraft 1.12 (Vanilla)**. It displays your **current free slots** and **total slots** in your bank. The addon automatically activates only when the bank window is open, ensuring efficient functionality. It also comes bundled with old FuBar-compatible libraries for seamless integration on WoW 1.12 private servers.

This addon is a perfect companion to **BagSlotsFu**, allowing players to monitor both their bag and bank space in tandem.

## Features
- **Bank Slot Tracking**: Displays the number of currently free slots and total slots in your bank.
- **Automatic Activation**: Activates and updates only when the bank window is open to reduce resource usage.
- **FuBar Integration**: Bundled with old FuBar-compatible libraries for full compatibility with FuBar on WoW 1.12.
- **Companion Addon**: Designed to work perfectly alongside **BagSlotsFu** for complete inventory management.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Specifically optimized for WoW 1.12 without modern bloat.

## Installation
1. Download manually, or if your patcher allows it add the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/brujoloco/BankSlotsFu.git

2. Let your patcher handle the install, select it on your patcher to enable it

3. If you prefer to do it manually move the BankSlotsFu folder to your WoW AddOns directory:

   World of Warcraft Folder \Interface\AddOns\

3. Start World of Warcraft and enable BankSlotsFu in the AddOns menu.

## Usage

BankSlotsFu will automatically display on your FuBar interface.

When you open a bank window, the addon will update to show:
Free Bank Slots: The number of empty slots available in your bank.
Total Bank Slots: The total number of slots in your bank.

Use it in tandem with BagSlotsFu to monitor both your bank and bag free slots


## Addon Pairing
BankSlotsFu is designed to be used alongside BagSlotsFu, but both addons can function independently. Together, they provide a complete overview of your inventory and bank space for efficient resource management.
